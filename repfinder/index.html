      <h1>repfinder</h1>
      <p>Finds repetitions in text, intended for English prose. Repetitions that are close to each other will be marked in orange. The stronger the color, the closer the repetition. You can click on a word to mark all of its occurences.</p>
      <p>This could probably be improved a bunch. Currently words have to match pretty exactly and e.g. singular and plural of the same word won't be recognized as a repetition. The algorithm for the intensity of the color is just something that seems to work for me, given the length of my paragraphs. Having to scroll up to update the text is pretty annoying, it would be nicer if that could be done from some kind of overlay. Maybe it would also be nice to somehow explicitly ignore repetitions, but that's pretty difficult to keep persistent other than mangling your text. It could probably also recognize obviously intentional repetitions, like when you say "over and over".</p>
